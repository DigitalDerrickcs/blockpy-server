<h2 id="0-read-problem">0) Read Problem</h2>
<p>You have a file called <code>grades.txt</code> (shown below) that contains every student's grade on a recent test, along with their name. To see if you need to apply a curve, you need to know the average grade for all the students. Find the average grade and print it. </p>

<p><a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='worked_examples/grades.txt')}}" target=_blank>View <code>grades.txt</code></a></p>

<h2 id="1-interpret-the-problem">1) Interpret the Problem</h2>
<p>This problem requires us to get the grades students scored from <code>grades.txt</code> and calculate the average. First, we need to see what <code>grades.txt</code> looks like. After opening <code>grades.txt</code>, we see it has a student's name and grade on each line, separated by a colon (':').</p>
<pre>Michael:90
Steven:70
Logan:67
...</pre>


<p>Since each line holds information for exactly one student, we need to look at each line. We can do this with a <code>for</code> loop. Once we get the individual lines as strings, we we can use the string method <code>split</code> to separate out the grade.</p>

<p>To determine the average, we can use the Sum and Count patterns. We will find the sum of all of the grade and divide the sum by the number of grades in the file. </p>

<h2 id="2-setting-up-sum-and-count-variables">2) Setting up Sum and Count Variables</h2>
<p>For the Sum and Count pattern, we need to create variables storing the sum and count before our loop begins.</p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grade_sum = 0
grade_count = 0
{%endfilter %}


<h2 id="3-opening-a-file">3) Opening a File</h2>
<p>Before we can use a file, we must open the file with the <code>open</code> function. This function takes the name of the file as a string and returns a file object representing the open file. We need to save this file object so we can close it later:</p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grades_file = open('grades.txt')
{% endfilter %}


<h2 id="4-iterate-over-lines-in-a-file">4) Iterate Over Lines in a File</h2>
<p>To look at each line of a file, we iterate over the file object.</p>

{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
for line in grades_file:
    ...
{% endfilter %}

<h2 id="5-extract-from-the-string">5) Extract from the String</h2>
<p>Now that we have a line of the file, we need to get the grade. Since the student's name and grade are separated by a colon, we use the <code>split</code> method to separate them. The <code>split</code> method takes the character that separates the different parts of the string and returns a list of each part. So if <code>line</code> was <code>"Michael:90"</code> </p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
line.split(":")
{% endfilter %}

<p>returns the list <code>["Michael", "90"]</code>. To get the grade from this list, we can use the second index (1).</p>

{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
line.split(":")[1]
{% endfilter %}

<p>Notice that the second item in the list is <code>"90"</code>, which has quotation marks. This means it is a string, which makes sense because it was originally part of a string. To convert this string to a number, we can use the <code>int</code> function, which takes a string and parse an integer out of it. </p>

{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grade = int(line.split(":")[1])
{% endfilter %}


<h2 id="6-update-the-sum">6) Update the Sum</h2>

<p>We add the grade to our running sum</p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grade_sum = grade_sum + grade
{% endfilter %}


<h2 id="7-increment-the-count">7) Increment the Count</h2>
<p>Every time we add a grade to the sum, we increase our count by one </p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grade_count = grade_count + 1
{% endfilter %}


<h2 id="8-close-the-file">8) Close the File</h2>
<p>Once our <code>for</code> loop finishes, we are finished with <code>grades.txt</code>, so we should close the file. This is done with the <code>close</code> method. </p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grades_file.close()
{% endfilter %}


<h2 id="9-calculate-the-average">9) Calculate the Average</h2>
<p>Once we've determined the sum and count of all the grades in the file, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count.</p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
grade_average = grade_sum/grade_count
{% endfilter %}


<h2 id="10-print-the-result">10) Print the Result</h2>
<p>Now we print the average to answer whether we should have a curve.</p>
{% filter highlight_python_code(False) -%}
print(grade_average)
{% endfilter %}
